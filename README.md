# paxos

paxos lib is a library aims to provide an abstract layer for reliable storage(I just made it up in the last 5 minutes)

# Motivation
~~To make the chubby from google !~~

Just kidding.

This repo's goal is to make paxos into a library that can be used across projects, the code skeleton is based on Tencent's PhxPaxos.

# Getting started
Don't get started, it is a mess right now!

...

in order to build the server, we need to use grpc_cpp_plugin, which is automatically installed after making grpc

# Future plans
* Add server and client(ongoing)
* Add travis ci
* Add docker support
* Add unittests
* Add multi-platform support
* Add benchmark
* Add Jepsen for validation
* Split examples into a new project, the reason why I haven't done that is because I can't come up with a good project name, LMAO
